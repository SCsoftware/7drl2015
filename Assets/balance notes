3 loops / 4 levels each loop
(12*4=48 credits avg)

starting item sale value = 4 - 1 per usage?
1.5 per level (4*4*3 = 48 for item sales)

should calculate difficulty as a function of the number of days + the credits you can earn minimum on a job
second loop kills me, so I need to buff items obviously

score up powers take up a powerup slot

//var dic = {"key":value}

unsold powerups multiply their value
